In this blog post, we will explore the step-by-step process of integrating Outstatic into a Next.js website, allowing for efficient content management and improved performance. The installation should take less than 10 minutes.

Requirements: A Next.js 13+ website and a GitHub Account.

## Setting up a GitHub OAuth Application:

Letâ€™s walk through the steps to create a GitHub OAuth Application, this is needed for authentication:

- First go to the "Register a new OAuth application" page on GitHub by [clicking here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

- App name: This could be **My Blog** or anything you want.

- Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000/`.

- Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/outstatic/callback`

- You can leave the **Application** description field empty.

Click on **Register application**. You'll be redirected to your GitHub Oauth App settings page.

Next, click on **Generate a new client secret**. Once done, keep this tab open. We'll need these values for our next steps.

## Install Outstatic

First install the Outstatic package and dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install outstatic

# yarn
yarn add outstatic

# pnpm
pnpm install outstatic
```

You will need to create two files in your Next.js `/app` folder. They have a very similar structure, but notice that the first one is under `/app` while the second under `/app/api`:

- `/app/outstatic/[[...ost]]/page.tsx`
- `/app/api/outstatic/[[...ost]]/route.ts`

Copy the following contents to the `page.tsx` file:

```typescript
import 'outstatic/outstatic.css'
import { Outstatic } from 'outstatic'
import { OstClient } from 'outstatic/client'

export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { ost: string[] } }) {
  const ostData = await Outstatic()
  return <OstClient ostData={ostData} params={params} />
}
```

And for the `route.ts`:

```typescript
import { OutstaticApi } from 'outstatic'

export const GET = OutstaticApi.GET

export const POST = OutstaticApi.POST
```

Start your dev server. Assuming you're on `http://localhost:3000` you can access your dashboard at `https://localhost:3000/outstatic`.

You should see this page:

## Setting up the Environment Variables

You will need to add the following variables to your `.env` file.

```bash
OST_GITHUB_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_APP_ID
OST_GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_APP_SECRET
# random string min 32 chars
OST_TOKEN_SECRET=A_RANDOM_TOKEN
OST_REPO_SLUG=YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_SLUG

# OPTIONAL
# If empty this will default to main
OST_REPO_BRANCH=YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_BRANCH
```

Restart your service and reload the `/outstatic` page.

If everything is setup correctly, then you'll see a login page and will be able to access your Dashboard.

Now that you have completed the installation and setup process of Outstatic, you can start creating content for your website.
