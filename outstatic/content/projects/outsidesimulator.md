[OutsideSimulator.com](https://outsidesimulator.com) was created during the pandemic to help people experience the outside world virtually. It provided a much-needed escape by bringing the beauty of the outside world to people's screens. 

Whether you wanted to wander through lush forests, stroll along sandy beaches, or marvel at architectural wonders, the website offered a diverse range of virtual experiences. Every now and then I get a [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/andrevitorio) or a nice message from a user who expresses gratitude for the website's ability to transport them to different outdoor locations. It's heartwarming to know that OutsideSimulator.com has made a positive impact during these challenging times.

On it's launch weekend the website received over 100 thousand visitors, which was a testament to the demand for virtual outdoor experiences at the time.
